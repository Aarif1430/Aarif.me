Deep learning is a branch artifical intelligence powered by neural networks.\nNeural Networks are a means of doing machine learning, in which a computer learns to perform some task by analyzing training examples. The first trainable neural network, <strong>the Perceptron</strong>, was demonstrated by the Cornell University psychologist Frank Rosenblatt in 1957. The Perceptron’s design was much like that of the modern neural net, except that it had only <strong>one layer with adjustable weights and thresholds, sandwiched between input and output layers</strong>. It's worth understanding how simple perceptron looks like and how they work? <br/> A perceptron takes several binary inputs <strong>x1, x2, x3..,</strong> and produces a single binary output. <br /></p>\n<p><img src=\"../../images/dl.png\"></p>\n<h3>Setup</h3>\n<pre><code>npm i &#x26;&#x26; ng serve\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Contribution</h3>\n<p>If you're new to contributing to Open Source on Github, <a href=\"https://guides.github.com/activities/contributing-to-open-source/\">this guide</a> can help you get started.
